excerpt: 'The high energy consumption in the greenhouse during the winter season necessitates the development of various thermal screens for energy-saving purposes. However, there is limited data on the precise properties of thermal screens, while little research has investigated a methodological approach for measuring the screen's energy-saving capacity for greenhouse energy efficiency. This research aims to determine the thermophysical, radiative, and aerodynamic properties of selected commercial greenhouse thermal screens. The transient system simulation (TRNSYS) model was used to simulate the heat flux and derive the thermal retention qualities of the thermal screens through their measured properties. The model was validated by comparing the simulated and experimental heat transfer coefficients, expressed as the overall heat transfer coefficient (U-value), thereby determining the thermal retention of the screens. In addition, the simulated U-value was compared to the experimental U-value in material permeability to investigate the influence of screen porosity on heat loss.'
