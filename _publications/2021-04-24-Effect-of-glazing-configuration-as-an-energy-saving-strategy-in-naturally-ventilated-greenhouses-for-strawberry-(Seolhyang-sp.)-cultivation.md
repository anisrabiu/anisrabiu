excerpt: 'Strawberry cultivation is highly dependent on environmental parameters and energy in winter. Two gothic greenhouses with different glazing material combinations, i.e. polyolefin-thermal screen (PoTS) and polyolefin-thermal screen-polyethylene (PoTSPe), were used for strawberry cultivation. The energy-saving capabilities of the two configurations and their impact on the microclimates of the greenhouses were investigated.'
