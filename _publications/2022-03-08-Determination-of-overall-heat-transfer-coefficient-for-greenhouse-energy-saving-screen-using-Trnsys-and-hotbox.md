excerpt: 'The high energy consumption in the greenhouse during the winter season necessitates the development of various thermal screens for energy-saving purposes. However, there is limited data on the precise properties of thermal screens, while little research has investigated a methodological approach for measuring the screen's energy-saving capacity for.'
